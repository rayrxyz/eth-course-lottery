# Lottery

A simple lottery app deployed on Ethereum testnet (Sepolia). 
Any address on the network can join by sending an ether amount to the contract
and the contract deployer (manager) can pick a winner. 

App interface is running on REACT and codes can be found [here](https://github.com/rayrxyz/lottery-react)
